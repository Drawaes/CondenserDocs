			<title>Patch 2.0.2</title>
			<link>http://drawaes.github.io/CondenserDocs/blog/server-progressing</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The first issue is the stripping of trailing names from the executing assembly should now be fixed with ".Host", ".Library" and
so on all removed by default. You can configure the suffixes you would like removed through the ServiceManagerConfig object.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Refactored the Client Libraries</title>
			<link>http://drawaes.github.io/CondenserDocs/blog/client-refactor</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;There has been a pretty large refactor of the client libraries. As with any very early API it has taken some time using the library in the real
world to gain an understanding of what works and what doesn't. This has shown that the current API for registering your services required
a lot of boilerplate code. Also if you wanted to change a single setting it required you to set a lot of settings you would like to leave it as
the defaults.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
